A: Try using the `--model-dir` parameter to specify a local model path, or use a proxy for download.

### 🚀 Usage Issues

**Q: Insufficient memory when processing large images?**
A: It is recommended to use production mode (`--production`) or adjust image preprocessing parameters to reduce memory usage.

**Q: Detection results are inaccurate?**
A: Ensure input image quality is good, lighting conditions are appropriate, and use image enhancement functions if necessary.

### 📊 Performance Optimization

**Q: How to improve processing speed?**
A: Use GPU acceleration (if available) or adjust batch processing size to optimize performance.

**Q: Minimum system configuration requirements?**
A: Minimum requirements: CPU i5-8400, 8GB RAM, 10GB storage. Recommended configuration: CPU i7-12700, 16GB RAM.
