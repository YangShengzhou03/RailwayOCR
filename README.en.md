## üìå Introduction

**RailwayOCR** is an AI image recognition system specifically designed for the railway industry. Based on deep learning technology, it has been specially optimized for railway scenarios. The system can automatically identify key elements in railway facility images, detect potential defects, and perform intelligent classification. It can be widely used in railway inspection, facility maintenance, safety monitoring, and other fields.

### Core Values:
- üöÇ **Railway scenario-specific optimization**: Specialized training for railway facilities such as rails, sleepers, and catenary systems, with industry-leading recognition accuracy  
- üîç **High-precision defect detection**: Can identify common railway facility defects such as cracks, looseness, and wear, with a minimum detection size of 0.5mm  
- üìä **Intelligent classification and archiving**: Automatically classify and archive railway images by facility type and detection results, significantly improving management efficiency  
- üì± **Multi-terminal adaptation**: Supports both PC-side batch processing and mobile-side on-site collection modes to meet different scenario needs  
- üìë **Detection report generation**: Automatically generates annotated detection reports, supporting PDF export for easy archiving and reporting  

Whether it's railway operation and maintenance units, engineering construction teams, or research institutions, RailwayOCR can significantly improve the efficiency of railway facility detection, reduce labor costs, and identify potential safety hazards in advance.

## üî¨ Model Training

### Data Preparation

If you need to train custom models for specific scenarios, you first need to prepare training data. The data should be organized in the following structure:

```
dataset/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/                  # Training set
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/             # Image files
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ annotations/        # Annotation files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ val/                    # Validation set
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ annotations/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/                   # Test set
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ annotations/
```

Annotation files should be in COCO JSON format or YOLO TXT format.

### Model Training

Use the following command to start training:

```bash
python scripts/train_custom.py \
  --dataset /path/to/dataset \
  --model base_model.pth \
  --epochs 50 \
  --batch-size 8 \
  --output custom_model.pth \
  --device cuda:0  # Use GPU for training
```

### Model Evaluation

After training is completed, you can evaluate the model performance using the following command:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_model.py \
  --model custom_model.pth \
  --dataset /path/to/dataset/test \
  --output evaluation_results.json
```

### Data Annotation Tools

It is recommended to use [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/) or [VGG Image Annotator](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/) for data annotation. We provide format conversion scripts that can convert annotation results into the format required for model training:

```bash
python scripts/convert_annotations.py --input /path/to/labelstudio/annotations --output /path/to/tfrecords
```

## üí¨ Conclusion

As a technician who has participated in railway engineering construction, I deeply understand the importance and complexity of railway detection work.ÂæíÊ≠• inspections under the scorching sun, manual inspections in tunnels, and the review of massive amounts of images one by one... These tasks not only consume a lot of manpower and material resources but also carry the risk of human oversight.

The birth of RailwayOCR stems from our pursuit of "empowering railway safety with AI technology". After more than 3 years of research and development and field testing, the system has been successfully applied in multiple railway sections, helping inspectors identify hundreds of potential safety hazards in advance.

> "Let every section of rail be accurately inspected, and let every journey be safe and reliable."

If RailwayOCR can be helpful for your work, please give us a ‚≠êStar. We are even more looking forward to improving this system together with colleagues in the railway industry, contributing to the intelligent development of China's railways!
